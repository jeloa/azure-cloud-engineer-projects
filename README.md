# Azure Cloud Engineer Projects Portfolio


A comprehensive portfolio demonstrating end-to-end Azure cloud infrastructure lifecycle management: from secure deployment through monitoring, troubleshooting, and cost optimization.

---

##  Portfolio Overview

This repository contains four interconnected projects that simulate real-world cloud engineering responsibilities. Each project builds upon the previous one, demonstrating a complete infrastructure lifecycle from initial deployment to ongoing operations and optimization.

### Why This Portfolio Matters

Cloud engineering is not just about deploying resources—it's about building secure, observable, resilient, and cost-effective infrastructure. This portfolio demonstrates:

- **Security-first thinking**: Implementing least-privilege access, network segmentation, and identity management
- **Operational readiness**: Building monitoring and alerting before issues occur
- **Incident response**: Systematic troubleshooting using root cause analysis
- **Business awareness**: Optimizing costs while maintaining service quality

### [Project 3: Infrastructure Troubleshooting & Root Cause Analysis](./03-troubleshooting-scenarios/)
**Focus:** Incident Response & Remediation  
**Time Investment:** ~3 hours  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

Diagnose and resolve four production-simulated infrastructure failures using systematic troubleshooting.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Structured incident response methodology (Detection → Diagnosis → Resolution → Validation)
- Network troubleshooting with NSG analysis and IP Flow Verify
- Storage performance investigation and disk space management
- RBAC permission auditing and role assignment
- Monitoring agent diagnostics and service recovery

**Key Technologies:** Azure Monitor, Log Analytics (KQL), NSGs, RBAC, Linux CLI, Network Watcher

**Scenarios Resolved:**
1. **Network Connectivity Failure**: NSG misconfiguration blocking HTTP traffic (Port 80)
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: Disk saturation at 99% capacity causing service failures
3. **Access Denied**: RBAC permission errors preventing VM management
4. **Monitoring Blackout**: Azure Monitor Agent service failure stopping telemetry

**Outcomes:**
- Applied systematic root cause analysis to restore services
- Utilized KQL queries to validate telemetry recovery
- Documented findings in professional RCA format

### [Project 4: Cost Management & Optimization](./04-cost-optimization/)
**Focus:** FinOps & Governance  
**Time Investment:** ~1 hour  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

Analyze spending patterns, implement cost controls, and optimize resource utilization.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Azure Cost Management analysis and reporting
- VM right-sizing based on utilization metrics
- Auto-shutdown scheduling for non-production workloads
- Resource tagging strategies for cost attribution
- Budget alerts and spend controls

**Key Technologies:** Azure Cost Management, Azure Advisor, Resource Tags, Budget Alerts

**Outcomes:**
- Reduced infrastructure costs by 50%+ through VM right-sizing (identified 4.5% avg CPU utilization)
- Implemented auto-shutdown schedules, reducing compute costs by ~30% (8 hours/day)
- Applied governance framework with standardized tagging (Environment, Project, Owner)
- Configured proactive budget alerts at 80% and 100% thresholds

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Active Azure subscription (free tier acceptable)

- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- SSH client (Windows PowerShell, Terminal, or PuTTY)

### Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with Project 1 (Security & Deployment)
2. Move to Project 2 (Monitoring)
3. Complete Project 4 (Cost Optimization)
4. Finish with Project 3 (Troubleshooting)

**For Experienced Users:**
- All projects can be completed independently
- Projects 2-4 build upon the infrastructure from Project 1
- Estimated total time: 7-8 hours across all projects

### Cost Considerations

**Estimated Monthly Costs (if left running 24/7):**
- Project 1-3: ~$10-15/month (B1s VM + associated resources)
- Project 4 optimizations reduce costs by 50%+

**Cost Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use Azure Free Tier credits ($200 for 30 days)
- Enable auto-shutdown for non-production hours
- Delete resources immediately after project completion
- Use B-series burstable VMs for cost efficiency

##  Lessons Learned

### Security
> "A 'default' deployment is often an insecure one. Security must be designed in from the start, not bolted on later."

### Monitoring
> "You can't troubleshoot what you can't observe. Monitoring must be validated, not assumed to work."

### Troubleshooting
> "Small configuration changes can cause major outages. Systematic root cause analysis is faster than random trial-and-error."

### Cost Management
> "Cloud resources left unmanaged will consume budget indefinitely. Engineers share responsibility for cost control."
